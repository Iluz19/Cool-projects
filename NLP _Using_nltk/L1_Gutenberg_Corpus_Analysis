The Gutenberg corpus includes texts from well-known authors such as Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Herman Melville.

What you need to do:

1. Load the Corpus: Load the Gutenberg corpus and list the file IDs available in the corpus.

2. Tokenization: Choose one text from the corpus (e.g., "shakespeare-hamlet.txt"). Tokenize the text into words and sentences.

3. Stop Words Removal: Remove stop words from the tokenized words. 

4. Stemming and Lemmatization: Apply stemming and lemmatization to the tokenized words. Compare the results and discuss the differences.

5. POS Tagging: Perform part-of-speech tagging on the tokenized words.

6. Named Entity Recognition: Identify named entities in the text.

7. Text Analysis: Determine the 10 most common words in the text (excluding stop words).
Identify the frequency of a specific word (e.g., "Hamlet"). 
Analyze the distribution of different parts of speech in the text.
