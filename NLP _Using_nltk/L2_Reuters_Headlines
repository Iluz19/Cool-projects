In this lesson we are going to work on Headlines on Reuters.
Nltk had a corpus called reuters so it will be approachable.

Our tasks for today are:

1. Filter all the headlines to ["crude", "grain"] categories,
classify 25% of the texts (test set) using 75% of the texts as train set. 
What happens when you get rid of the stop words?
- Don't forget to shuffle the documents, so you'll not have a bias

2. Filter to only "grain" and use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to learn about the topics.

3. Analyze the sentiment of the texts that are categorized as crude. 
What do you think of the result? Remember, sentiment range is [-5, 5]
