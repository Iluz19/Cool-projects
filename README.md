"Eaternity" is a volunteer project I did to impress a company named eaternity.
Eaternity is a Swiss company based in ZÃ¼rich, aiming to bring a solution for the food industry,
to measure exactly and efficiently the environmental footprint of food products.
In the project, I generated a basic LLM (Gemini pro) that will hopefully help potential customers to reduce their environmental footprint,
offering them slight variations of their dishes in order to reduce their footprint. 
The model states the change of texture/taste of the dish if implementing these variations
