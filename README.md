Predict la liga is a notebook which predicts scores in la liga. it consists on basic grading system and "machine learning"
i use there only 2 libraries- pandas and numpy.
of course it is not as consistent as it can with ml libraries and bigger data but i did this for the soul and not for the money :)


arab poetry is just a flex of how good i am with pandas library and plotting stuff
