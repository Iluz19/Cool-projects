SELECT * FROM sample WHERE col1 = “val1” ; filter
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM sample; count and name the total
SELECT * FROM sample ORDER BY col1 ASC/DESC; order by
SELECT * FROM sample WHERE col1 = 100; find specific rows
UPDATE sample SET col1 = ‘new value’ WHERE col2 = 1500; update col2’s col1 value 
DELETE FROM sample WHERE col1 = 3000; delete rows
INSERT INTO sample (col1, col2…) VALUES (val1, val2 …); add rows
